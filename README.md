# Grade Assigner

## Developer
Elvis Nunez

## Project Description
This Java application reads student scores from the user and assigns grades based on predefined score ranges. The program demonstrates the use of conditional statements in Java to determine grades and provides instant feedback on student performance.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure that Java is installed on your system by typing `java -version` in the command prompt or terminal.
2. Obtain the source code by downloading it from the repository or cloning it using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Move to the directory where the project files are located.
4. Compile the Java program with:
   ```
   javac GradeAssigner.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java GradeAssigner
   ```

## Usage
- When prompted, input each student's score. The program accepts scores as integers.
- After a score is entered, the program will display the corresponding grade based on the following scale:
  - 90 to 100: A
  - 80 to 89: B
  - 70 to 79: C
  - 60 to 69: D
  - Below 60: F
- Continue entering scores for as many students as needed.

## Example
```
Enter student score: 85
Grade: B

Enter student score: 92
Grade: A

Enter student score: 58
Grade: F
```

The program is designed to be simple and user-friendly, ideal for educational purposes, and to help new programmers understand the use of conditional logic in Java.
